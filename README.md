# LSTM Model for User Classification

This project implements an LSTM model for predicting user classification based on various features. The model processes user data to determine their status and eligibility for specific services.

## Project Contents

- `lstm_model.py`: The main code for the LSTM model and data preprocessing steps.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of libraries required to run the project.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
