## Code Description

The code implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for user classification based on various input features. Below is a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The code begins by loading user data from a CSV file and filling any missing values.
   - It includes feature engineering steps, such as creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., total purchase frequency and amount).
   - Target variable creation is done based on conditions derived from the dataset.

2. **Feature Preparation**:
   - Relevant features are selected for training the model, and the target variable is defined.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure the model can be evaluated effectively.

3. **Normalization**:
   - The features are normalized using `StandardScaler` to improve the model's performance and convergence during training.

4. **Model Definition**:
   - An LSTM model is defined with specified parameters such as input size, hidden layer size, number of layers, and dropout rate.
   - The model consists of an LSTM layer followed by a fully connected output layer.

5. **Training Loop**:
   - The model is trained over a specified number of epochs, with the training loss and accuracy calculated at each step.
   - The optimizer used is Adam, and the loss function is Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits, suitable for binary classification tasks.

6. **Validation and Evaluation**:
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
   - Confusion matrix and other visualizations are generated to analyze model predictions.

7. **Results Visualization**:
   - The code includes several plots to visualize training and validation accuracy, loss curves, ROC curves, and Precision-Recall curves, providing insights into model performance.
   - SHAP values are computed to interpret the model's predictions and understand feature importance.

8. **Model Saving**:
   - Finally, the trained model weights are saved for future use or deployment.

This structured approach ensures that the model is well-prepared for user classification tasks and provides comprehensive insights into its performance.
